# Groq AI Service Integration with Smart PDF Viewer

## Overview
This sample demonstrates the integration of Groq AI service with the SyncfusionÂ® Blazor Smart PDF Viewer. Groq provides ultra-fast AI inference through their specialized hardware and optimized models, enabling real-time intelligent document processing capabilities including rapid content analysis, summarization, and contextual question-answering directly within PDF documents.

## Key Features
- Groq AI Service Integration: Direct connection to Groq's high-speed AI inference platform
- Ultra-Fast Processing: Lightning-fast AI responses powered by Groq's specialized hardware
- Intelligent Document Analysis: AI-powered content extraction and analysis with minimal latency
- Real-time Summarization: Instant document summarization using optimized language models
- Interactive Q&A: High-speed question and answer functionality with document context
- Cost-Effective Processing: Efficient AI processing with competitive pricing models
- Multiple Model Support: Access to various open-source models optimized for Groq infrastructure

## How It Works
The Smart PDF Viewer connects to Groq's AI inference service through secure API calls. When users request AI features, the viewer sends document content to Groq endpoints, which process the information using high-performance language models running on specialized hardware, delivering exceptionally fast responses that are seamlessly integrated into the PDF viewing experience.
