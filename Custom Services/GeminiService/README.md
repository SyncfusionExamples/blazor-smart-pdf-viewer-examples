# Google Gemini AI Service Integration with Smart PDF Viewer

## Overview
This sample demonstrates the integration of Google Gemini AI service with the SyncfusionÂ® Blazor Smart PDF Viewer. This implementation leverages Google's advanced Gemini AI models to provide intelligent document processing capabilities, including content analysis, summarization, contextual understanding, and interactive question-answering directly within PDF documents.

## Key Features
- Google Gemini AI Integration: Direct connection to Google's Gemini AI models
- Advanced Language Understanding: Multi-modal AI capabilities for text and document analysis
- Intelligent Document Summarization: AI-powered content extraction and summarization
- Contextual Q&A: Interactive question and answer functionality with document context
- Multi-language Support: Process documents in various languages using Gemini's multilingual capabilities
- Real-time Processing: Fast AI responses with optimized API integration
- Flexible Model Selection: Support for different Gemini model variants (Gemini Pro, Gemini Pro Vision)

## How It Works
The Smart PDF Viewer communicates with Google Gemini AI service through secure API calls. When users interact with AI features, the viewer sends document content to Gemini endpoints, which process the information using state-of-the-art language models and return intelligent, contextually relevant responses that are seamlessly integrated into the PDF viewing experience.
