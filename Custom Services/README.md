# Custom AI Service Integration with Smart PDF Viewer

## Overview
This sample demonstrates how to integrate a Custom AI service with the SyncfusionÂ® Blazor Smart PDF Viewer using User Token authentication. The integration enables AI-powered features such as document summarization, contextual question and answering, and personalized document assistance directly within PDF documents.

## Key Features
- Custom AI Service Integration: Connect your preferred AI service provider
- User Token Authentication: Secure authentication mechanism for AI services
- Document Summarization: AI-powered content summarization of PDF documents
- Interactive Q&A: Ask questions about PDF content and receive intelligent responses
- Contextual Analysis: AI analyzes document context to provide relevant insights
- Seamless PDF Integration: Native integration within the PDF viewer interface

## How It Works
The Smart PDF Viewer communicates with your custom AI service through a secure User Token-based authentication system. When users interact with AI features, the viewer sends document content to your AI service endpoint, which processes the content and returns intelligent responses that are displayed directly within the PDF interface.

## Configuration
To use this sample with your own AI service:
1. Configure your AI service endpoint URL
2. Set up User Token authentication credentials
3. Customize AI service parameters based on your requirements
4. Deploy the application to test the integration
