# Azure AI Service Integration with User Token Authentication

## Overview
This sample demonstrates the integration of Azure AI service with the SyncfusionÂ® Blazor Smart PDF Viewer using User Token authentication. This implementation provides secure access to Azure's advanced AI capabilities for intelligent document processing, including content analysis, summarization, and contextual question answering within PDF documents.

## Key Features
- Azure AI Service Integration: Direct connection to Azure Cognitive Services
- User Token Authentication: Secure token-based authentication mechanism
- Intelligent Document Analysis: AI-powered content extraction and analysis
- Document Summarization: Automated summarization of PDF content using Azure AI
- Contextual Q&A: Interactive question and answer functionality with document context
- Real-time Processing: On-demand AI processing with immediate response display
- Secure Communication: Encrypted communication between viewer and Azure services

## How It Works
The Smart PDF Viewer establishes a secure connection with Azure AI services through User Token authentication. When users request AI features, the viewer sends document content to Azure AI endpoints, which process the information using advanced machine learning models and return intelligent responses that are seamlessly integrated into the PDF viewing experience.

## Azure AI Service Configuration
To implement this sample with Azure AI services:
1. Create an Azure Cognitive Services resource in your Azure portal
2. Obtain your Azure AI service endpoint URL
3. Generate and configure User Token credentials
4. Set up the authentication parameters in your application
5. Configure AI model settings based on your requirements

## Authentication Setup
The User Token authentication provides secure access to Azure AI services:
- Token-based authentication eliminates the need for direct API key exposure
- Configurable token expiration and refresh mechanisms
- Role-based access control for different user permissions
- Secure token transmission and storage

## Supported Azure AI Services
This integration supports various Azure AI capabilities:
- Text Analytics for content analysis
- Language Understanding for contextual processing
- Document Intelligence for structured data extraction
- Custom models for specialized document processing
