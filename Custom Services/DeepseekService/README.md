# Deepseek AI Service Integration with Smart PDF Viewer

## Overview
This sample demonstrates the integration of DeepSeek AI service with the Syncfusion® Blazor Smart PDF Viewer. It leverages DeepSeek’s cutting-edge language models to enable intelligent document processing, including contextual understanding, summarization, and interactive question-answering directly within PDF documents.

## Key Features
- DeepSeek AI Integration: Seamless connection to DeepSeek’s advanced LLMs
- Contextual Language Understanding: High-performance NLP for document analysis
- Smart Summarization: AI-powered extraction of key insights from content
- Interactive Q&A: Ask questions and receive context-aware answers from PDFs
- Multilingual Support: Analyze and translate documents across languages
- Real-time AI Responses: Optimized API calls for fast and accurate output
- Model Flexibility: Support for DeepSeek Chat, DeepSeek Coder, and other variants

## How It Works
The Smart PDF Viewer sends document content to DeepSeek AI via secure API calls. When users invoke AI features, the viewer transmits relevant data to DeepSeek endpoints. The AI processes the input using state-of-the-art models and returns intelligent, context-aware responses that are displayed within the PDF interface.
